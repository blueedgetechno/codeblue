## An Atom package for all your competitive coding needs

A codeforces helper that can test, run, present and submit solutions on codeforces
<br>

![overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blueedgetechno/codeblue/master/img/code.gif)

### Installation
Step 1.
```
apm install codeblue
```
Step 2.
```
pip install online-judge-tools
```
Step 3.
```
oj l https://codeforces.com/
```

## Features

- Fetch and load details of live codeforces contest ⚡
- Automatically create an environment for contest including working files 💻
- Run code with official sample cases of any particular problem 🔭
- Compare your output with expected output in a elegant manner 📺
- Get your code verdicts like OK ✅, Wrong answer ❌, TLE 🕒, MLE 🛢, Runtime error or Compilation error ⚠, Queue ⏳, Hacked ☠️
- Submit 🏳‍🌈 your code from your favorite text editor
- Get your official standing of the live contest 👥
- Play minigames while you wait for the contest 🎮

## Updates
- Now supports the feature to test and run C++(g++ compiler) and C (gcc compiler) language codes 🎉🎊
- Option to run code for case independent problems 📡

## Guide
- Set your preferences in settings of the package, in advance
- Delete the folders and files of working directory before contest
- Click on Refresh button to refresh the standing
- Click on your standing to minimize problems view
- Click on your profile picture to refresh problems
- Click on an example number to copy its input data

## Limitations
- I will try to remove the dependency of online-judge-tools for non-python users in future updates

- While running C or C++ files, it sometimes run the previously compiled file and shows the same verdict. Incase of that delete the previously compiled file and run the code again

##### Any feedback will be highly appreciable
